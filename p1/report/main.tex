    \textit{Abstract: accurate and informative? }
    The abstract gives the reader a quick overview of what has been done and the most important results. Try to be to the point and state your main findings.
    
    In this work, I have written the code, which implements several regression algorithms, namely \textit{Linear Regression}, \textit{Ridge Regression} and \textit{LASSO regression}. Th code has been tested firstly on the artificial and then on the real data - Norwegian terrain.
