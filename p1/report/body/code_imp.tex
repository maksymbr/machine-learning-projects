\textit{Code/Implementations/test: Readability of code, implementation, testing and discussion of benchmarks.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the methods and algorithms
    \item You need to explain how you implemented the methods and also say something about the structure of your algorithm and present some parts of your code
    \item You should plug in some calculations to demonstrate your code, such as selected runs used to validate and verify your results. The latter is extremely important!! A reader needs to understand that your code reproduces selected benchmarks and reproduces previous results, either numerical and/or well-known closed form expressions.
\end{itemize}
